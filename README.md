# Dokku NGINX Stream plugin (Alpha)

**Note:** A maintained version can be found here: https://github.com/josegonzalez/dokku-nginx-stream

**Note:** Alpha software. Pull Requests are welcome

**Note:** Only one tcp port per app is supported

Dokku NGINX Stream gives the ability to open up tcp ports
to the outside world. This can be usefull when your application
speaks more than http.

**Note:** Your app must use the proxy plugin.

## Install and usage

```sh
# dokku 0.5+
$ sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/rvanlaar/dokku-nginx-stream.git
```
## Usage
Nginx Stream leverages the proxy plugin for enabling tcp ports:
```
dokku proxy:ports-add myapp tcp:EXTERNAL_PORT:INTERNAL_PORT
dokku ps:rebuild
```

**Note** The Nginx-stream only configures the ports after
a rebuild or deploy.

More information on proxy configuration can be found here:
[dokky port management](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/networking/port-management/)

## Technical

Nginx can loadbalance tcp and udp ports via:
[ngx_stream_core_modules](http://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html)

A `nginx-stream.conf` is generated from the proxy settings
and included in the main nginx.conf via
```
stream {
    include /home/dokku/*/nginx-stream.conf;
}
```
